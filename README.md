Crescentfallen is a single or multiplayer campaign centered around crafting guns, fighting unique enemies, making machines, powering yourself up, tower defense, finding lore, making food, and building rockets. Originally, this was going to be a story driven mod, similar to moreplanets with a heavier focus on lore. Slowly, overtime, it jut simply grew into more. I think I can make a pretty fun combat system by piecing together peoples work, including a lot of my own, so I decided to expand this into a fullblown adventure pack sort of merged with a machine progression pack with unique concepts behind it, and plans for a full progression system.

Currently looking for help from developers with creating this mod! I have some experience in java, and am not just looking for someone to do it for me, but for people to work with. Please contact me if you are interested, I would appreciate it so much!

This mod is dedicated to the creators of Galacticraft, Moreplanets, and Extraplanets for inspiring me to make this.
